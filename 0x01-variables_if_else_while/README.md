## Task 
- 0 - Assigns a random number, then prints if the number is positive, 0, or negative.
- 1 - Assigns a random number, takes the last digit in the number and then prints if it is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 but not 0.
- 2 - Prints the alphabets in lowercase using ASCII code.
- 3 - Prints all alphabets except the letters 'q' and 'e', in lowercase using ASCII code.
- 4 - Prints all alphabets in lower case first then upper case using ASCII code.
- 5 - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- 6 - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 using ASCII code.
- 7 - Prints alphabets in reverse in lowercase using ASCII code.
- 8 - Prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase using ASCII code.
- 9 - Prints all single digit numbers in ascending order with a comma and space in between them using ASCII code.
- 10 - Prints all numbers from 00 to 99 in ascending order with a comma and space in between them using ASCII code.
- 11 - Prints all two digit combinations but not the inverses of the lowest combination in ascending order.
- 12 - Prints all three digit combinations but only the lowest value of the permutations (012 is printed but not 120, 102, 021 etc.) in ascending order.
- 13 - Prints all two two-digit numbers, the two numbers are separated by a space and pairs are separated by a comma and space. (Eg. 00 01, 00 02) Only one permutation between two numbers can be printed eg. 00 01 is printed then 01 00 cant be printed.
